GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2024 Attis
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                    Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if
you want it, that you can change the software and use pieces of it
in new free programs, and that you are informed about your rights to
do these things.  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions
that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender
the rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
rights that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so
they know their rights.

Developers that use the GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users'
and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked
as changed so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously
to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them.  This is fundamentally
incompatible with the intention of granting users freedom to change
the software.  The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the
area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it
should be possible for users to assert their rights.  Therefore, we
defend the right to use modified versions of the software on these
products by prohibiting the practice for those products from denying
access to the software.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively
restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a software patent
on it.  Therefore, we insist that any patent must be licensed for
everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and
modification follow.
